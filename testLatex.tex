\section{Introduction}
This is the report to for Smart Building Project. It covers the procedures I have taken so far
\section{Setting-up Raspberry Pi}
\subsection{Obtaining the Raspberry Pi Operating System}
The RPI image can be obtained from:
\newline
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/
\newline
The image is:
Raspbian Stretch Lite, a minimal image based on Debian Stretch.
The lite image is for a headless install. All communication to the RPI is made via ssh.
\newline
Version: November 2018
\newline
Release date: 2018-11-13
\newline
Kernel version: 4.14 
\newline
Download and unpack the image.
\newline
I have used both Windows and Linux Debian to create the bootable operating system so that I get a greater knowledge and understanding of completing the flash process.
%\newline
\subsection{Windows flashing}
Check the hash, SHA-256 of the image.
\newline
Use Windows built-in certUtil -hashfile Path/To/File/file.img SHA256 to compute the hash.
\newline
Insert SD card into Windows 10 machine.
\newline
Use Etcher to flash image, obtained from:
\newline
$https://www.balena.io/etcher/$
\newline
Download Etcher and install.
\newline
Using Etcher, select source (Path to  .img), Destination (SD card)
Flash the card.
Dismount then remount SD card.
Donot repair the card when asked to by Windows.
CMD into the card then create an empty file named ssh with no extension.
\newline
At the prompt>  type nul > ssh
\newline
This will give secure shell access. Info can be found at:
\newline
