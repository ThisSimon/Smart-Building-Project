# Smart-Building-Project
An offline system to recognise the owner/occupier of a building by the use
of image recognition and speaker dependent recognition, to match a face with
a voice profile, allowing the unlocking of a door and the overiding of the
lighting and heating systems.
The occupier has returned home and the Smart-Building has rcognised them

# Use's
A person using a zimmer frame would not need to find keys for the door leaving
their hands free
A person who is slightly forgetfull would not need to remember their keys
A person leaving the house for a few minuets would never leave the door unlocked
accidentaly if they were longer than intended
The door would always be locked to intruders, never left open at night by
accident.
Family members of a person using the system would be given the "piece of mind"
by knowing the door was always locked for security.
